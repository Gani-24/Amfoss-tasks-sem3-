## Web Scraper using Rust
This task was good, i took my time with it as i had to go through many things to do this.
Finally was able to make it work.
- The program makes a GET request to the URL
- The HTML content is parsed
- A csv::Writer instance is created, and now a header row specifying the column names is written into the CSV file.
- The extract_data function will extract the data from the html using css selectors
- The extracted data is written to the csv file.

# Overall was a good task, cant say i am perfect with rust now, but can definetly say better than before.
