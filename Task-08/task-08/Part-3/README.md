<p>In this part of the task, you will be adding some styles to your website</p>

<p>In the index.html file, you will notice that all seven buttons have a common class "drum" and unique classes of their own</p>

<p>You have to target every button via their unique class in the CSS class and give a background colour of your choice to all of them </p>

<p>Post this, you can add a box shadow to all buttons to make it look more elegant</p>
