# Part 2 of this task

In this part, you will be adding sound functionality to your website so that whenever a button on the site is clicked, a particular sound should play

You will see that there are 7 buttons on the site and 7 audio files in the [`sounds`](https://github.com/rv602/Internet-Explorer/tree/master/sounds) folder

You have to link every button to corresponding audio file so that when any button is pressed, a unique sound is heard

You can start by adding `onClick` event listeners to all the buttons and calling necessary functions so that when a button is pressed, a function is called and necessary events may be carried out
