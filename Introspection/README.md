I am working on a Project since the past week, it just started and i will continue to work on it in the nedxt few months along with doing my own personal projects and improving my knowledge in backend and frontend developement.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I think i can contribute to the club well, i have worked on projects before with other people in the last semester and know my capabilities and i can provide significant contribution to the club in projects and other stuff.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection process was excellent, i mean to say in simple words, the tasks were not too easy or too hard, it was just perfect. I thought the same with the previous year tasks as well. Doing these tasks now compared to last time showed the difference in what we can do with proper knowledge and application. These tasks really introduces various stuff in the developement field.
