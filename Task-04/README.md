## INTERESTING TASK

This was a very interesting task to do
- I wanted to explore this earlier, so this task helped me get into it.
- will definetly try other bots and stuff with this

## Made the required changes
Overall
- The code uses the Telebot library to create a bot that responds to user commands on Telegram
- The /movie command allows users to enter a movie title and get its details, which are obtained by sending an HTTP request to the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API
- The bot has a global variable called bot_running, which is used to determine whether the bot is currently running or not
- The bot continuously polls for new messages using the infinity_polling() method from the Telebot library

### It was a good task, will easily help us to learn lot of things about creating telegram bots.
